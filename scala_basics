Scala - Program Structure
A Scala program can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate by invoking each other’s methods.

Components of a Scala program:
Class - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint/structure that describes the behaviors/states that are related to the class.
Object - An object is an instance of a class and has states and behaviors. Example - A car has color, make, model as states and move, brake, as behaviors.
Methods - A method is a behavior of a class and hence of its instantiated objects. Methods have logic and code to manipulate the data and execute the action.
Fields - A field is state of a class and hence of its instantiated objects, which define properties of the objects. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these fields.
Closure - A closure is a function, which returns values depending on the input to it. Input is given via values assigned to variables declared outside this function.
Traits - A trait encapsulates method and field definitions, which can then be reused by mixing them into classes. Traits are used to define object types by specifying the signature of the supported methods.
Variables - Variables are placeholders for any attributes which need to be calculated, manipulated or assigned to. This is similar to any other programming language.
We will study about these building blocks in upcoming sessions.

Scala - Data Types
Scala has all the same data types as Java, with the same memory footprint and precision.

You will notice that integers and strings are the most commonly used data types to represent the real world entities.

Let's have a look at Scala data types.
Byte - 8 bit signed value. Range from -128 to 127
Short - 16 bit signed value. Range -32768 to 32767
Int - 32 bit signed value. Range -2147483648 to 2147483647
Long - 64 bit signed value. -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807
Float - 32 bit IEEE 754 single-precision float
Double - 64 bit IEEE 754 double-precision float
Char - 16 bit unsigned Unicode character. Range from U+0000 to U+FFFF
String - A sequence of Chars
Boolean - Either the literal true or the literal false
Unit - Corresponds to no value
Null - null or empty reference
Nothing - The subtype of every other type; includes no values
Any - The supertype of any type; any object is of type Any
AnyRef - The supertype of any reference type

###Assignment Operators

=    Simple assignment                  C = A + B
+=   Add AND assignment                 C += A     (same as C = C + A )
-=   Subtract AND assignment            C -= A     (same as C = C - A )
*=   Multiply AND assignment            C *= A     (same as C = C * A )
/=   Divide AND assignment              C /= A     (same as C = C / A )
%=   Modulus AND assignment             C %= A     (same as C = C % A )
<<=  Left shift AND assignment          C <<= 2    (same as C = C << 2)
>>=  Right shift AND assignment         C >>= 2    (same as C = C >> 2)
&=  Bitwise AND assignment              C &= 2     (same as C = C & 2 )
^=  bitwise exclusive OR and assignment C ^= 2     (same as C = C ^ 2)
|=  bitwise inclusive OR and assignment C |= 2     (same as C = C | 2)

###Variables

1)Variables are reserved memory locations used to store values
2)Mutable and Immutable
3)Mutable are defined using var keyword and their values can be changed
4)Immutable are defined using val keyword and their values cannot be changed.In cases of threads,API,functions and classes we may not want some of the variables to change
5)Variable type Inference - Scala can identify the type of the variable without defining
5)Scala supports multiple assignments. If a code block or method returns a Tuple (Tuple ? Holds collection of Objects of different types), the Tuple can be assigned to a val variable.
Example:
val (myVar1: Int, myVar2: String) = Pair(40, "Foo")

##String operations

object Hello {
  def main(args:Array[String]) {
    var str:String = "hello"
    println(str)
    str = "hello all"
    println(str)
    str.concat("there")
    println(str)
  }
}
##Notations
printf("The value of the float variable is " + " %f,while the value of the int variable is "+" %d , and the value of string variable is "+" %s" ,floatVar,in
tVar,stringVar)
Interpolation:
This mechanism evaluates the string value in runtime.
Strings can be interpolated or expanded using various ways.
The s interpolator
It allows the use of variable directly in processing a string, when you prepend ‘s’ to it.
val name = "John"
println(s"Hello $name") //output: Hello John
String interpolation can also process arbitrary expressions.
println(s"2 + 3 = ${2 + 3}") //output: 2 + 3 = 5

The raw interpolator
Output with raw option:
println(raw"Result = \n a \n b")
Result = \n a \n b

###Scala String Methods

var str:String = "My name is Ajinkya,I am 27 years old,I want to be data scientist, I will be working hard on this"
var strarray = new Array[String](3)
strarray = str.split(",")
println("New string breakup  is " + strarray.deep.mkString("\n"));
Scala - String Methods
There are many methods to work on strings and we will discuss here a few important ones.

int length() - Get string length:

var str1:String = "one"
println("Length is " + str1.length());
String concat(String) - Concat one string to another:

var str1:String = "one"
var str2:String = str1.concat(" two")
println("Combined string is " + str2);
char charAt(int index) - Returns the character at the given index first index being 0:

var str:String = "New York"
println("Char at 5th index is " + str.charAt(4));
String replace(char oldChar, char newChar) - Returns a new string after replacing all occurrences of string oldChar with string newChar:

var str:String = "New York"
println("New string is " + str.replace("York","Shire"));
String replaceAll(char oldChar, char newChar) - Returns a new string after replacing all occurrences of string oldChar with string newChar. It is same as replace function but additionally, it can also use regular expressions (regex).

var str:String = "New York 1ab2c3"
println("New string is " + str.replaceAll("[0-9]","x"));
To replace multiple chars, use | separator between patterns.

var str:String = "New York"
// replace all w and k with z
println("New string is " + str.replaceAll("w|k","z"));
String[] split(String regex) - Splits the string around matches of the given regular expression.

var str:String = "New,York,Hello, There"
var strarray = new Array[String](3)
strarray = str.split(",")
println("New string is " + strarray(0));
println(strarray.deep.mkString("\n"))
String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex) - Returns the substring of a string ending at endIndex-1.

var str:String = "NewxYorkyHello, There"
var str1 = str.substring(4,9)
println("New string is " + str1)
##Function in Scala to remove Vowels##
object PurgeVowels {
def myPurge(str:String):String = 
{
  var str2 = str.replaceAll("|a|e|i|o|u|A|E|I|O|U]","")
  return str2
}
}
PurgeVowels.myPurge("New York") 

###Conditional Statements

##For Loop
scala> for(x<-a)
     | {
     | println(x)
     | }
##While loop

 while(x > 0)
     | {
     | println(x)
     | x = x - 1
     | }
##IF Loop     
  def simpleinterest(principal :Int,rate: Double,years: Int): Double = {
     | if (principal < 0) {
     | printf("Principal cannot be negative")
     | return 0
     | }
     | var interest = principal * rate * years/100
     | return interest
     | }
simpleinterest: (principal: Int, rate: Double, years: Int)Double
scala> simpleinterest(-100,2.7,10)
Principal cannot be negativeres0: Double = 0.0

####If-Else Condition
object Hello {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var x = 5;

      if( x < 10 ){
         println("If condition is true");
      } else {
         println("If condition is false");
      }
   }
}

###For Loop Examples
object Hello {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var a = 0;

      // for loop execution with a range
      println("Loop 1 - simple loop")
      for( a <- 1 to 5){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

      println("Loop 2 - loop with custom incremental value")
      for( a <- 1 to 10 by 2){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

      println("Loop 3 - loop in reverse, decreasing order")
      for( a <- 5 to 1 by -1){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

      println("Loop 4 - loop using until, one iteration less than simple loop")
      for( a <- 5 until 1 by -1){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

      println("Loop 5 - loop over collections")
      val myList = List(1,2,3,4,5);
      for( a <- myList ){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
      }

      println("Loop 6 - loop over multiples ranges, loop within loop")
      for( a <- 1 to 5; b <- 1 to 3){
         println( "Value of a: " + a );
         println( "Value of b: " + b );
      }
   }
}

object Greet
{
def greet(time:Int) = 
{
if(time >= 4 && time <= 12){
println("Good Morning")
}
else if(time >= 12 && time <= 16){
println("Good Afternoon")
}
else if(time >= 16 && time <= 20){
println("Good Evening")
}
else if(time >= 20 && time <= 24){
println("Good Night")
}
else if(time >= 0 && time <= 4){
println("Good Night")
}
else{
println("Please enter correct time")
}
}

####Defined full name method

class Person(val fname: String,val lname:String,val anage:Int) {
      val firstname:String = fname;
      val lastname:String = lname;
      val age:Int = anage;
      def getfullname():String = 
        {
      return firstname + " " + lastname
        }
      }
     
 Objects are useful in defining constants and utility methods as they are not related to any specific instance of the class. Utility methods take parameters and return values based on a calculation and transformation
 
 object Hello{
     | def message():String = {
     | return "Hello,Goof Morning!!!"
     | }
     | }
     
    
     }

When you are calling the Car() class and passing these three strings then it will be stored inside the variables "makeOfCar", "modelOfCar", "yearOfCar". which are stored in the make, model and year respectively just like the constructor.
var car1 = new Car("Honda", "City", 1996);
var car2 = new Car("Honda", "Accord", 1999);
var car3 = new Car("Honda", "Amaze", 2015);
Then by calling the car1.make, car1.model, car1.year, you are accessing these variable and printing it.

class Car(makeOfCar: String, modelOfCar: String, yearOfCar: Int) {
   var make: String = makeOfCar;
   var model: String = modelOfCar;
   var year: Int = yearOfCar;
   var color = "";
   def changeColor(colorOfCar: String) {
      color = colorOfCar;
      println ("New color of car:" + color);
   }
}

object Demo {
   def main(args: Array[String]) {
      var car1 = new Car("Honda", "City", 1996);
      var car2 = new Car("Honda", "Accord", 1999);
      var car3 = new Car("Honda", "Amaze", 2015);
      println("Car details:" + car1.make + " " + car1.model + " " + car1.year + " " + car1.color)
      println("Car details:" + car2.make + " " + car2.model + " " + car2.year + " " + car2.color)
      println("Car details:" + car3.make + " " + car3.model + " " + car3.year + " " + car3.color)
   }
}

class Student(var uname:String,var usex:Char,var ugrade:Int,var nage:Int){
     var name:String = uname;
     var sex:Char = usex;
     var grade:Int = ugrade;
     var age:Int = nage;
     }
     
 ###Using constructor    
class Student() {
var name: String = "";
var sex: Char = 'F';
var grade: Int = 5;
var age: Int = 12;

def this(name_a: String) {
this()
this.name = name_a
}

def this(name_a: String, sex_a: Char) {
this()
this.name = name_a;
this.sex = sex_a;
}

def this(name_a: String, sex_a: Char, grade_a: Int, age_a: Int) {
this()
this.name = name_a;
this.sex = sex_a;
this.grade = grade_a;
this.age = age_a;
}

}


##Function Representation in Scala

def add(x :Int,y:Int): Int = {
return x+y
}
def add(x:Int,y:Int): Int = {
x+y
}
##In case of single blocks
def add(x:Int,y:Int)= x+y

def functionName ([list of parameters]) : [return type] = {
   function body
   return [expr]
}                   
scala> object Calc{
      def calSum(x:Int,y:Int):Int ={
      var sum:Int = 0
      for(a<-x to y){
      sum+=a
      }
      return sum
     }
      }
      
  ###A closure is a function, whose return value depends on the value of one or more variables declared outside this function.
A closure also works as a variable.

     val multiplier = (i:Int) => i * 10
     var factor = 3
     val multiplier = (i:Int) = i * factor
     
     object Hello
     {
     def main(args: Array[String]){
          println("multiplier(1) value = " +  processme(1) )
          println("multiplier(2) value = " +  processme(2) )
          }
          var factor = 4
          val processme = (i:Int) => i * (factor + 1)
      }
      ##Scala collections provide different ways to store data.
     #The Scala collections hierarchy represents a structure of collections that can contain data in different ways.
 
 @Scala Collections type:
 
Traversable -->Iterable ------> Seq,Set,Map----->
Seq----> Indexed Sequence and Linear Sequence
---Ordered collection of data
---Elements may or may not be indexed
----Examples are array,list and vector
----An array contains elements of the same type. Arrays are fixed in size and contain an ordered sequence of data. Array values are contiguous in memory,
which means that the values are stored in consecutive memory addresses. Array elements are indexed by position
-----Arrays have a zero-based index. To access the first element type languages(0). Arrays in Scala are mutable. We can change the values at specific indexes.
To change "SQL" to "C++" type languages(1) = "C++"
----List in Scala represents a linked list having elements such that each element has a value and pointer to the next element. These lists have poor performance as data could be located anywhere in the memory.
Compared to an array, a list is very flexible, as you do not have to worry about exceeding the size of the list.


Set -----> Sorted Set and Bit Set
---A set in Scala is a bag of data with no duplicates. Also, the ordering is not guaranteed in sets.
var set = Set(76,5,9,1,2)
var nums = List(1,2,3)
Tuples
1)Tuples can hold elements of different data type
2)var t = (14,45.69,"Australia")
3)var t = Tuple3(14,45.69,"Australia")
tuples can be accessed using a 1-based accessor for each value. To access the first element, type t._1. To access the third element type t._3
#tuples can be deconstructed into names bound to each value in the tuple. Let us understand it
Map -----> SortedMap
1)Collection of key/value pairs
2)Allows indexing values by a specific key for faster access
3)Java HashMap,Python Dictionary
4)Scala provides two types of maps - immutable and mutable. Please note by default, Scala uses the immutable Maps. It means that you can not change the value of a key. 
If you want to use the mutable maps, import scala.collection.mutable.Map class explicitly.
###A range generally is an iterable thing and in scala all the iterables are presents in "Array._" module. So you need to import it

##Scala - Assessment - Declare an Iterator
Iterator in Scala is a way to access the elements of a collection one by one. The two basic operations on an iterator are next (to access the next item and put the pointer to next to next item) and hasNext (to check whether an iterator has more items or not).
A simple example of declaring and looping over iterator is given below:
val it = Iterator("You", "are", "next")
while (it.hasNext){
    println(it.next())
}
An iterator is a collection of items which can be traversed using hasNext() and next() to get the next item. An iterator can be traversed only once after which items are lost.


###Writing to a file

Scala uses java.io.File class to write the files to the operating system.
A File object is created followed by an object of PrintWriter class. The write function of PrintWriter class does the writing to the file.

Below example create a new File object and writes the lines to it.
import java.io._
object IOTest {
    def main(args:Array[String]) {
        val writer = new PrintWriter(new File("new.txt"))
        writer.write("Hello There Scala")
        writer.close()
    }
}

####Reading a file

import scala.io.Source
for(line <- Source.fromFile("new.txt").getLines){
    println(line)
}

###we can use Java libraries in Scala.
